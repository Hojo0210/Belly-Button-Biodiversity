# Belly-Button-Biodiversity

## Overview
  The purpose of this challenge was to take a json file and use the data to make a wep page that creates a bar, bubble, and gauge chart based on a selected sample number. The selection is available through a drop down list, and it updates the charts once a new selection is made. Some edits were also made for aesthetic purposes.
